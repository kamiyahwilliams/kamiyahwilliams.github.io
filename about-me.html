    	<p> My name is Kamiyah Williams and I'm from San Leandro, California. I have one older sister and one younger sister. I go to San Lorenzo High School and am apart of my class commitee. I enjoy reading, listening to music, hanging out with my friends, and video games. I hope to join my school's BSU, Key club, and keep going to committee this upcoming freshmen year. </p>
